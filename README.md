## Usage

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```sh
  npm run dev
```
This will start the development server and the project will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Upon running the project, you will be presented with a user interface displaying two buttons: "Login" and "View Demo."

If you prefer not to go through the login process and simply want to explore the project's functionalities, click on the "View Demo" button. This option provides instant access to the admin account, bypassing the need for manual login.

Upon logging in, you'll see a dashboard panel with a chart. This chart shows data about the chosen user's tasks across the current year, grouped by month. If logged in as an employee, you'll only see your own data on the chart. Easily track your productivity and task completion progress using the chart!

All users will have access to the tasks page, where they can view a list of tasks. Employees will only see their own tasks on the table, while managers and admins will have additional privileges. Managers and admins can create, edit, and delete tasks from the table as needed.

In addition to the tasks page, admins will also have access to the team page. On the team page, admins can manage the roster of managers and employees. They have the authority to create, edit, and delete managers or employees to ensure the team is up-to-date and well-organized.
